# MIP-Change-and-Stability
General MIP paper on the effects of climate change over the past millennium on multiple aspects of ecosystem state

This repository houses the scripts for a forth-coming manuscript that describes the PalEON MIP, its drivers, and assess the relationship between ecosystem stability pre-1850 and how well the model hits modern benchmarks.
